# PCB Stonehenge
Inspired by the tombstone effect I created this silly little project.

Provided are the KiCad files including a custom footprint for the main stone circle. This is the third PCB I've ever made, so don't expect miracles xD

To manufacture the PCB you only really need front copper and mask and the edge cuts. The back is empty an there are no holes or silk screen. The pre-packed gerber zip in the files was accepted by JLC without issues.

The Assembly folder contains a picture with numbered pads and a list of which size component goes on which pad in which orientation. There's also a folder with pictures of the finished board which you can use for reference. You'll need 28x 1206, 12x 0805, 5x 0603 and 13x 0402.

Based on your experience the assembly might be a bit of a challenge. The pads are tight for aesthetic reasons, but keep in mind that it doesn't matter if you heat a component for too long since they don't need to work. I used a small chisel tip and a needle tip for my iron as well as a 10x optical stereo microscope which worked really well. You'll definitely need some form of magnification, especially for the 0402 components.
