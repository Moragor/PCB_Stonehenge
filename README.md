# PCB Stonehenge
Inspired by the tombstone effect I created this silly little project.

Provided are the KiCad files including a custom footprint for the main stone circle. This is the third PCB I've ever made, so don't expect miracles xD

The Assembly folder contains a picture with numbered pads and a list of which size component goes on which pad in which orientation. There's also a folder with pictures of the finished board which you can use for reference. You'll need 28x 1206, 12x 0805, 5x 0603 and 13x 0402.
